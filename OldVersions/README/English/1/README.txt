`🇸-🇩-🇪📱️🌐️💾️🔌️ SDE MobileServer Hugo support plugin.`

***

## Summary

This plugin adds Hugo support to your server.

2 variants are available. One is written in Google Go. Before a functional build is available, there needs to be a distribution of Google Go that doesn't contain telemetry or trackers, and can work with this project.

In the meantime, a Rust variant will also be available. It will also be a test to see if Rust can outperform Google Go in speed.
